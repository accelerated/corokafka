Description: Coroutine-based Kafka library. Scalable and easy to use C++ library built on top of
    librdkafka, cppkafka and quantum, allowing multiple parallel producers and consumers. Producing and consuming of
    messages is simplified by allowing applications to use their own native message formats which are automatically
    serialized and de-serialized by the library. Compiles for -std=gnu++11, -std=gnu++14 and -std=gnu++17.
